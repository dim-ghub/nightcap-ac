# Vox TTS Architecture

Vox TTS is designed to provide fast, local text-to-speech synthesis directly into Roblox voice chat through [Nightcap](https://github.com/CoderDayton/nightcap) on Linux.

Unlike typical voice-chat soundboards or TTS tools, Vox TTS **does not require**:
- Virtual audio cables (PulseAudio null sinks, PipeWire virtual nodes).
- Virtual microphone loops.
- Separate Electron or Python companion applications running in the background.

Instead, the entire system is implemented as a single, lightweight shared library (`libvox_tts.so`) that operates simultaneously across two complementary subsystem layers:

1. **SDL3 Dynamic Interception (`LD_PRELOAD`)**: Hooks audio capture and user input to extract chat and inject audio.
2. **Implicit Vulkan Overlay Layer**: Intercepts Vulkan swapchain presentation to draw an in-game settings menu.

Both halves reside within the exact same loaded shared library, sharing process memory, state structures, and thread synchronizations.

## 1. SDL3 Interception (`src/sdl_hooks.cc`)

Nightcap interacts with the host windowing and audio subsystem through libSDL3. By using `LD_PRELOAD`, `libvox_tts.so` wraps key SDL3 symbols before forwarding them to the real SDL runtime (`dlsym(RTLD_NEXT)`):

### A. Chat Message Tracking (`src/chat.cc`, `src/chat.h`)
Roblox chat text boxes open on keystroke (`/`) and commit on Enter.
- `ObserveChat()` intercepts `SDL_EVENT_TEXT_INPUT` and `SDL_EVENT_KEY_DOWN`.
- `ChatTracker` mirrors the active Roblox text input field:
  - Tracks character insertions, deletions, cursor navigation, home/end, and word jumps.
  - On `Return` / `Enter`, the completed message buffer is emitted.
  - If the message begins with `/` (and `skip_commands` is enabled in config), the message is ignored (e.g. `/e dance`, `/w user`).
  - Otherwise, the message is dispatched to the speech synthesis worker thread via `nac::Say()`.

### B. Microphone Audio Injection (`src/speech.cc`)
- Nightcap opens the microphone capture stream via `SDL_OpenAudioDeviceStream()`.
- Whenever Nightcap reads recorded audio samples from the microphone, `MixIntoMic()` is called on the buffer before it is passed to Roblox.
- If TTS audio is queued:
  - Synthetic samples are resampled to match the device stream rate.
  - Volume scaling is applied (`vc_volume`).
  - If `mix_real_mic` is enabled, the synthetic speech is mixed on top of the real hardware microphone samples; if disabled, real microphone audio is muted while speech plays.

### C. Speaker Playback
- If the user selects output to speakers (`local` or `both`), a dedicated playback stream is created via `SDL_OpenAudioDeviceStream(SDL_AUDIO_DEVICE_DEFAULT_PLAYBACK)`.
- Playback volume is controlled independently via `local_volume`.

### D. Input Forwarding & Cursor Unlocking
- While the in-game menu is open:
  - Keystrokes, mouse clicks, and scroll events are consumed by the overlay and blocked from reaching Roblox.
  - When Roblox requests first-person mouse lock (`SDL_SetWindowRelativeMouseMode(true)`), Vox TTS temporarily disables relative mouse mode and shows the system cursor so the user can interact with the menu.
  - Upon closing the menu, previous mouse lock and cursor states are restored seamlessly.

## 2. Vulkan Overlay Subsystem (`src/layer.cc`, `src/overlay.cc`, `src/ui.cc`)

The in-game menu is rendered natively within the game's Vulkan rendering pipeline using an implicit Vulkan layer.

### A. Vulkan Layer Negotiation
- The Vulkan loader detects `vox_tts_layer.json` (or `nightcap_ac_layer.json`).
- `vkNegotiateLoaderLayerInterfaceVersion()` negotiates layer hooks with Vulkan loader v2 interface.
- Hooks are established for:
  - `CreateInstance` / `DestroyInstance`
  - `CreateDevice` / `DestroyDevice`
  - `CreateSwapchainKHR` / `DestroySwapchainKHR`
  - `QueuePresentKHR`

### B. Rendering Synchronization
- On each frame, inside `QueuePresentKHR`:
  - A secondary command buffer is acquired for the swapchain image.
  - Dear ImGui generates draw commands for the Roblox-styled overlay menu.
  - Synchronization semaphores ensure rendering occurs strictly after the game finishes drawing its frame, but before the image is presented to the display server.

### C. Performance Optimization & UI Responsiveness
To avoid frame drops or input stutter:
- Model directory discovery and executable availability checks use in-process tokenized PATH checks (`access(..., X_OK)`) with a 5-second TTL cache (`src/tts.cc`).
- No shell processes or subshells are spawned on the UI rendering thread.
- Render loop operates at the game's full native refresh rate (e.g., 60–144+ FPS).

## 3. IPC & Control Socket (`src/control.cc`)

Vox TTS runs a UNIX domain datagram socket at:
`$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/vox-tts/control-<pid>.sock`
(with a backward-compatible symlink at `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/nightcap-ac/control-<pid>.sock`).

When a user executes `vox-tts` from a terminal, application launcher, or `roblox://` link while Nightcap is already active:
- The launcher finds the running game's PID from Mocktail/Nightcap instance locks.
- It transmits an `open` datagram to the socket.
- The game immediately brings up the overlay menu and raises the window.
